## Jacob Grimes
- I am a graduate from James Madison University as of December 2025, where I studied Computer Science focusing in Systems Development
- I have been working studiously in this field since my freshman year of high school, and have written different forms of software since my senior year of high school.
  - These include:
      - Working with a team to develop a simple Operating System, based off of the Stanford PintOS project
      - Working with a team developing software through Agile methodologies (Scrum)
      - Working with a team developing a web-based application with a database backend
      - Working with a partner developing a web-based application using third party APIs
  - I also have some personal projects I have worked on and plan to work on in the futre including
      - Completed:
          - [ProjectAutomation](https://github.com/grime3ja/ProjectAutomation): A project where I take menial tasks that I like to do daily and send it to an email group of different people. Finished November 2025.
      - Future Projects:
          - Mobile app that will serve as a grocery list for users. Inspiration behind this is my parents are always printing out grocery lists, and paper is a thing of the past.
          - Self hosted email server. Inspiration behind this was when Google announced that they can read emails to train their AI. I do not like not having my privacy put at rist, so they can't do that with my own email server.
          - Self hosted web server. Inspiration behind this is that I am cheap, and do not want to pay to host my websites.
          - grimeSH. A CLI that will be able to do typical Linux-like commands and also run some of my own projects that run in the command line. Inspiration behind this is I have always wanted something that can natively run my projects that I write, so why not write my own command line.
